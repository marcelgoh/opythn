# OPythn
OPythn is a non-GM compiler and bytecode interpreter for a core subset of Python that contains no added colours or preservatives. A full report, containing the complete language specification as well as various implementation details, can be found [here](./docs/report.pdf).

### Installation

OPythn was developed on macOS but should work on any Unix(-like) operating system. To be able to compile OPythn, you must have [OCaml](http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html) installed on your system, as well as the following packages:

+ [extlib](https://github.com/ygrek/ocaml-extlib)
+ [menhir](http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/)
+ [ppx_deriving](https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppx_deriving)

If you use OPAM, running `opam install extlib menhir ppx_deriving` should get you set up.  

Once you have all the requisite packages installed, simply run `make` from the main `opythn` directory to compile the program. This should not take more than a second or two. To delete compiled output, run `make clean`.

### Usage

Once compiled, OPythn can be started using commands of the format `./main (options)* [filename]` (from the main `opythn` directory). A list of valid command-line options can be displayed by running `./main --help`. Calling `./main` with no options or file arguments starts the default REPL. Enter statements line-by-line for OPythn to evaluate. The REPL saves the current environment between inputs.

|          Type "Ctrl-C" for options.          |

```

Entering `Ctrl-C` interrupts the REPL so you can quit the program or set various flags.  

Another way to run OPythn source code is to first write it in your favourite text editor and save it in a `.opy` file. Then simply run `./main [filename]` to run your code. You can try this out with some of the programs in the `examples` folder (e.g. `./main examples/is_it_ok.opy`).

### Running tests

The `test` folder contains a bunch of test cases. If you plan on modifying the interpreter in any way, you should periodically run the tester to ensure that everything still works: From the main `opythn` directory, run `cd test` and then `sh run_tests.sh` to run all tests. If all goes well you'll see a message that says `All tests passed.` If not, run `cat diff_log.txt` to see which cases failed. You can add a new test case by simply adding a `.opy` file to the `test` folder. The tester runs each file with Python 3 and OPythn and then compares the outputs. (You'll need Python 3 installed on your system for this to work.)
